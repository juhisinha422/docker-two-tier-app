Containerized Two-Tier Application (Flask + MySQL)
Aug 2025 - PresentAug 2025 - Present
Orchestrated a complete two-tier web application from scratch, containerizing a Python Flask backend and a MySQL database using Docker. Developed a Docker Compose file to manage the multi-container environment, enabling automated builds, service discovery, and persistent data storage.
Key Skills Demonstrated:
• Containerization & Orchestration: Created a custom Dockerfile for the application tier and used Docker Compose to define and link the two services over a private network.
• Backend Development: Built a simple but functional RESTful API with Flask that connects to and verifies the status of the MySQL database.
• Security: Implemented security best practices by passing database credentials as environment variables and scanning the final image for vulnerabilities with Docker Scout.
• Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Defined the entire application stack declaratively in the docker-compose.yml file for repeatable and consistent deployments.
